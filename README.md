# sign_language_detection_model
 Creats a Convolutional Neural Network to recognize and predict sign language messages. The model utilizes MediaPipe,  Numpy, Tensorflow, OpenCV, and other technologies in gathering keypoints and training the model. The model is then hosted on a Flask backend to then present a live demo of the model.
